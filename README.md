Script intended to ease the burden of seeding a Squad server.

Primary functionality:

- Ability to automatically join a server, launching the game from the desktop.
- Since as far as i know, you can't use Steam's protocol to join a server directly from the desktop, this is achieved using OCR(Optical Character Recognition),
- which finds and clicks the correct buttons for joining a server.

- Ability to automatically close, hibernate or shutdown computer upon hitting a certain player threshold.

- These two in conjunction allow

At this point in this, all you need to do for the script to work, is to start it, 
go into the settings;
* Add your name to the player name field
* Add the server IP and Query port - You can find these by going into [battlemetrics](https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/squad),
find your desired server there, and read them off that servers' page.
