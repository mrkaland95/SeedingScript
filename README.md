Script intended to ease the burden of seeding the server.

Primary functionality:

- Ability to automatically join a server using OCR.
- Ability to automatically close the game, put computer to sleep or power down upon hitting a specified threshold


At this point in this, all you need to do for the script to work, is to start it, 
go into the settings;
* Add your name to the player name field
* Add the server IP and Query port - You can find these by going into [battlemetrics](https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/squad),
find your desired server there, and read them off that servers' page.
