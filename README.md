# SeedingScript
SeedingScript v2.0 

Now includes a GUI/some buttons for choosing which option you want to execute. Also compiled into an executable so you won't need the python interpreter and the dependencies downloaded. To use, simply enter the "dist" folder and download the "squadrestart.exe" file
